# 🌟 Generative AI in Mobile App Development: Opportunities & Challenges

## 📱 Mobile App Development Lifecycle
The typical lifecycle includes:
1. **Design** – UI/UX planning
2. **Development** – Coding and feature building
3. **Testing** – Bug and functionality checks
4. **Publishing** – Launch on app stores
5. **Marketing** – User acquisition
6. **Support** – Post-launch assistance

## 🤖 Role of Generative AI at Each Stage
| Stage        | Generative AI Use Case                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design       | Generates UI layouts and color schemes based on user data   |
| Development  | Suggests code via natural language (e.g., GitHub Copilot)   |
| Testing      | Automates test case generation and bug simulation           |
| Publishing   | Optimizes app store metadata and descriptions               |
