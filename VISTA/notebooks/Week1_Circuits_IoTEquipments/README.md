# Week 1: Introduction to IoT, Circuits, and Voltage

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of IoT architecture.
- Learn fundamental concepts of electricity: **voltage**, **current**, and **resistance**.
- Get familiar with **passive circuit components**: resistor, capacitor, and inductor.
- Prepare for hands-on Arduino work by understanding how circuits work behind the scenes.

## ðŸ§± Core Concepts

### âš¡ Electric Current
- **Definition:** Flow of electric charge (usually electrons).
- **Analogy:** Like water flowing in a pipeâ€”driven by pressure (voltage).
- In copper wires (used in Arduino), free electrons move when voltage is applied.

### ðŸ”‹ Voltage
- Voltage is the **potential difference** that pushes current through a circuit.
- Created by a power source like a battery or Arduinoâ€™s 5V pin.

### ðŸ”Œ Circuit Elements
These are the basic building blocks for all Arduino circuits.

#### 1. Resistor (ðŸŸ«)
- **Purpose:** Limits current to protect components.
- **Symbol:** Zigzag `â€”\/\/â€”`
- **Arduino Use:** Always used with LEDs to prevent burning them out. Also used in voltage dividers and sensors.

#### 2. Capacitor (âš¡)
- **Purpose:** Stores and releases electrical energy.
- **Symbol:** `â€”||â€”`
- **Arduino Use:** Used in timing circuits, analog signal smoothing, or debounce buttons.

#### 3. Inductor (ðŸ§²)
- **Purpose:** Stores energy in a magnetic field.
- **Symbol:** Coil `â€”ooooâ€”`
- **Arduino Use:** Used in motor driver circuits, power supplies (less common for beginners).

## ðŸ”§ Connecting to Arduino Projects

Even though no hardware is used this week, understanding these basics is **crucial** before you:
- Blink an LED
- Read from a sensor
- Control a motor or buzzer

For example:
