## üîß 6. Basic Circuit Example

**Battery + Resistor + LED:**

```
[ + ] --- [Resistor] --- [LED] --- [ - ]
```

- **Voltage**: From battery
- **Current**: Flows through
- **Resistance**: Limits current
- **LED**: Glows when current flows

**Ohm's Law Example:**  
Given `V = 9V`, `R = 330Œ©`:  
`I = V / R = 9 / 330 ‚âà 27 mA`

## üß† 7. Key Takeaways for Building Circuits

- Always define **voltage, current, and resistance** clearly.
- Use **SI prefixes** for readability (`kŒ©`, `ŒºF`).
- Know your **power budget** (don‚Äôt overload components).
- Understand **tolerances** (real components are not perfect).
- Use **symbols and schematics** instead of photos or messy drawings.
- Prototype first using breadboards or simulation tools.
- Use **engineering notation** and correct units when labeling values.

## üß∞ 8. Circuit Architecture Mindset

- Start with: **Power source** (battery or supply)
- Add: **Load** (LED, motor, sensor)
- Protect with: **Resistors, capacitors**
- Use: **Wires or PCB traces** for flow
- Document: Use standard symbols and diagrams
- Check: Use meters or simulators to validate design

## üìé 9. Systems of Units (MKS, SI, CGS)

- SI = Standard in modern science and engineering
- MKS = Meter‚ÄìKilogram‚ÄìSecond, used in engineering
- CGS = Centimeter‚ÄìGram‚ÄìSecond, used in physics

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ 10. A Fun Fact

- 1 Amp = 6.24 √ó 10^18 electrons per second
- 1 mole of electrons = ~96,485 C (Faraday's constant)
- First electron experiment: J.J. Thomson (1897)
- Current flow was defined by Ben Franklin ‚Äî in the *wrong direction* (conventional current flows + to ‚àí, electrons go ‚àí to +)
