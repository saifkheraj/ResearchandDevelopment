# üí° Smart Room Light System - IoT Project (Beginner Friendly)

This project is part of an IoT learning journey. It uses basic components like an Arduino UNO, an LDR sensor, and a relay to build a **Smart Light System** that automatically turns on when it's dark.

---

## üìò Project Goal
Automatically switch ON a light when it gets dark and OFF when it‚Äôs bright, using an **LDR (light sensor)** and a **Relay module**.

## üß± Circuit Diagram Overview

### üîå LDR Wiring:
```
[5V] --- [LDR] --- (A0 on Arduino)
                     |
                  [10kŒ© Resistor]
                     |
                   [GND]
```

### ‚ö° Relay Wiring:
- Relay VCC ‚Üí 5V on Arduino
- Relay GND ‚Üí GND
- Relay IN ‚Üí D7
- Light bulb connected to relay's Normally Open (NO) and Common (COM) pins

## üî£ Signals Overview

| Signal Type | Component      | Description                       |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Analog      | LDR            | Gives values from 0‚Äì1023          |
| Digital     | Relay          | Receives HIGH or LOW signal       |

## üíª Arduino Code
```cpp
int ldrPin = A0;
int relayPin = 7;
int threshold = 500;

void setup() {
  pinMode(relayPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin);
  Serial.println(ldrValue);

  if (ldrValue < threshold) {
    digitalWrite(relayPin, HIGH); // Light ON
  } else {
    digitalWrite(relayPin, LOW);  // Light OFF
  }
  delay(500);
}
```

---

## üîç How It Works
1. LDR senses brightness.
2. Arduino reads LDR value.
3. If it‚Äôs dark (value < 500), Arduino sends HIGH to relay ‚Üí light turns ON.
4. If it‚Äôs bright (value ‚â• 500), Arduino sends LOW ‚Üí light turns OFF.

## üõí Starter Kit Recommendation
Instead of buying parts separately, get an **Arduino Starter Kit**:
- Comes with sensors, breadboard, wires, LEDs, relay, and more.
- Good brands: Elegoo, Official Arduino, Keyestudio

---

## ‚úÖ Learning Goals
- Understand analog and digital signals
- Learn wiring and voltage divider concept
- Practice coding in Arduino IDE
- Control real-world devices (AC light) using a relay

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Next?
- Add a mobile app to control it manually (ESP8266 or ESP32)
- Add a temperature sensor for Smart Fan control
- Control multiple lights based on room zones

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Tip:** If you're using a 220V light bulb, be extremely careful and consult a professional if unsure. Relays isolate control voltage from AC, but wiring AC current should be handled with proper insulation.
