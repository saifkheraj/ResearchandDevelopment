## 🧠 Microcontroller vs. Microprocessor

| Feature               | Microcontroller (Arduino) | Microprocessor (Computer) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Clock Speed          | ~16 MHz                   | ~2+ GHz                   |
| RAM                  | ~2 KB                     | ~8+ GB                    |
| Cost                 | Very low                  | Much higher               |
| Power Consumption    | Low                       | High                      |
| Use Case             | Embedded systems          | General-purpose computing |

Arduino boards use **microcontrollers** which are powerful enough for many real-world applications, but not for heavy tasks like video/image processing.

## 🔧 Hardware Components & Starter Kit

You can complete this course using a **free online simulator** (no hardware needed). Check the simulation section above.  
**However**, using real hardware is more fun and lets you build real-life projects. While waiting for components, you can simulate online and switch to hardware later.

### Recommended Starter Kit

A starter kit includes all components you need—and more for future projects. You can also buy parts separately if preferred.

**Kit Includes**:
- **Arduino Board**: UNO (official or clone), Nano, or Mega  
- **USB Cable**: Type-A to B (for UNO) or micro-USB (for Nano)  
- **Breadboard**: Full-size for prototyping  
- **Jumpers**: Male-to-male wires  
- **Resistors**: Assortment (≥220 Ω and 10 kΩ common values)  
- **LEDs**: At least 3 (various colors recommended)  
- **Push Button**: Momentary switch  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: HC-SR04 (distance measurement)  
- **LCD Screen**: 16×2 character display  
- **Infrared Remote & Receiver**: IR remote control kit  
- **Photoresistors**: Light-dependent resistors (≥2 pcs)  

> Note: Component appearance may vary by supplier—functionality is what matters.
