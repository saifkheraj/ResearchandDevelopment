## 🧠 Microcontroller vs. Microprocessor

| Feature               | Microcontroller (Arduino) | Microprocessor (Computer) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Clock Speed          | ~16 MHz                   | ~2+ GHz                   |
| RAM                  | ~2 KB                     | ~8+ GB                    |
| Cost                 | Very low                  | Much higher               |
| Power Consumption    | Low                       | High                      |
| Use Case             | Embedded systems          | General-purpose computing |

Arduino boards use **microcontrollers** which are powerful enough for many real-world applications, but not for heavy tasks like video/image processing.

## 🧑‍💻 Software: Arduino IDE Installation & Setup

Arduino IDE runs on **Windows, Linux,** and **MacOS**. It includes:
- **Text editor** for writing code  
- **Compiler** to translate code  
- **Uploader** to send code to your board  
- **Utilities** to simplify development

### 1. Download & Install
1. Visit the [Arduino Software Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
2. Choose **Arduino IDE 2.x (latest)** or **IDE 1.x (legacy)**. Both work for this course.  
3. Download the installer for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
4. Run the installer and follow prompts (accept license, choose install location).  
5. Launch the Arduino IDE from your desktop or applications menu.

### 2. Basic Setup
- **Board & Port**:  
  - Connect your Arduino via USB.  
  - In **Tools → Board**, select your board (e.g., Arduino Uno).  
  - In **Tools → Port**, choose the correct serial port.

### 3. Editor Customization (IDE 2.x)
- **Font Size**:  
  - Go to **File → Preferences**.  
  - Set **Editor Font Size** (e.g., 18) for comfortable reading.
- **Interface Scale**:  
  - In **Preferences**, adjust **Interface Scale** (e.g., 1.2×) to enlarge UI.
- **Theme**:  
  - In **Preferences**, switch between **Light** and **Dark** theme.

### 4. Tips for IDE 1.x
- **Zoom**: Press **Ctrl/Cmd + Scroll** to zoom in/out.
- **Line Numbers**: Enable via **File → Preferences → Display Line Number**.
- **Custom Font**:  
  1. Close the IDE.  
  2. Edit `preferences.txt` (in IDE settings folder).  
  3. Change `editor.font=monospace` to `editor.font=Consolas`.  
  4. Restart the IDE.

> With your IDE installed and configured, you're ready to write and upload your first sketch!

## 🔧 Hardware Components & Starter Kit

You can complete this course using a **free online simulator** (no hardware needed). Check the simulation section above.  
**However**, using real hardware is more fun and lets you build real-life projects. While waiting for components, you can simulate online and switch to hardware later.

### Recommended Starter Kit

A starter kit includes all components you need—and more for future projects. You can also buy parts separately if preferred.

**Kit Includes**:
- **Arduino Board**: UNO (official or clone), Nano, or Mega  
- **USB Cable**: Type-A to B (for UNO) or micro-USB (for Nano)  
- **Breadboard**: Full-size for prototyping  
- **Jumpers**: Male-to-male wires  
- **Resistors**: Assortment (≥220 Ω and 10 kΩ common values)  
- **LEDs**: At least 3 (various colors recommended)  
- **Push Button**: Momentary switch  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: HC-SR04 (distance measurement)  
- **LCD Screen**: 16×2 character display  
- **Infrared Remote & Receiver**: IR remote control kit  
- **Photoresistors**: Light-dependent resistors (≥2 pcs)  

> Note: Component appearance may vary by supplier—functionality is what matters.
