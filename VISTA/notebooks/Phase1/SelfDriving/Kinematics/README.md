## 🚀 Kinematics Summary Table (Simplified Style)

| Concept          | What it Tells Me                                                 | Includes                   | Example                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Distance**     | How much total ground I covered                                  | Just amount (no direction) | Walk 5m forward + 3m back = **8m**             |
| **Displacement** | How far I ended up from the starting point and in what direction | Distance + Direction       | Walk 5m forward, 3m back → **+2m** (forward)   |
| **Speed**        | How fast I'm moving (but not where)                              | Only magnitude             | **10 m/s** (no direction)                      |
| **Velocity**     | How fast and where I'm moving                                    | Speed + Direction (vector) | **10 m/s east**, or **−10 m/s** if going back  |
| **Acceleration** | How my velocity is changing over time                            | Change in velocity + time  | Speed goes from 0 to 20 m/s in 4s → **5 m/s²** |

## 🧠 Core Concept Flow

We started with:

* **Distance**: Total path covered, no direction.
* **Displacement**: Net change in position — with direction.
* **Speed**: How fast, without direction.
* **Velocity**: Speed + direction.
* **Acceleration**: How fast the velocity is changing over time.
* **Time**: The background for all change. All motion happens over time.

These concepts lead to the development of **Kinematic Equations**, which help us predict:

* Future velocity
* How far an object will move
* How long it takes to stop/start

## 📐 First Kinematic Equation

**Equation:** $v = v_0 + at$

**What it means:**

> Current velocity = Initial velocity + (acceleration × time)

**Example:**
A car starts from rest and accelerates at 3 m/s² for 5 seconds:
$v = 0 + 3 \times 5 = 15 \, \text{m/s}$

So, after 5 seconds, the car is moving at 15 m/s.

## 🔄 Breaking Velocity into Components Using Angle θ

When a robot or object moves at an angle, its velocity can be split into **horizontal (x)** and **vertical (y)** components using trigonometry.

### 🎯 Goal:

Understand why:
$v_x = v \cdot \cos(\theta), \quad v_y = v \cdot \sin(\theta)$

### 📐 Standard Diagram:

```
             ↑ y-axis
             |
             |      / velocity vector v
             |     /
             |    /
             |   / 
             |  /  
             | /   
             |/θ    
   (origin) *------------------------→ x-axis
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

* The robot moves at speed $v$ at an angle $\theta$ from the x-axis
* You form a **right triangle**:

  * Hypotenuse = total speed $v$
  * Adjacent side = $v_x$ → how much is moving in x-direction
  * Opposite side = $v_y$ → how much is moving in y-direction

### 📏 Use Trigonometry:

* $\cos(\theta) = \frac{v_x}{v} \Rightarrow v_x = v \cdot \cos(\theta)$
* $\sin(\theta) = \frac{v_y}{v} \Rightarrow v_y = v \cdot \sin(\theta)$

### ✅ Final Kinematic Formulas:

$\dot{x} = v \cdot \cos(\theta) \quad \text{(x-direction velocity)}$
$\dot{y} = v \cdot \sin(\theta) \quad \text{(y-direction velocity)}$

### 🧪 Real Example:

If a robot moves at:

* Speed: $v = 10 \, \text{m/s}$
* Angle: $\theta = 60^\circ$

Then:

* $v_x = 10 \cdot \cos(60^\circ) = 5 \, \text{m/s}$
* $v_y = 10 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 8.66 \, \text{m/s}$

So it moves:

* **5 m/s forward** (x)
* **8.66 m/s upward** (y)
