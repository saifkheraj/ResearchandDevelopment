## üö® Real-World Autonomous Vehicle Failures: Learning from Tragedy

### üìä **Summary of Major AV Incidents**

| Incident | Date | Company | Outcome | Root Cause | Industry Response |
|----------|------|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Waymo vs Bus** | March 2016 | Google/Waymo | Property damage | Prediction failure | Behavioral modeling improvements |
| **Uber Rollover** | 2017 | Uber | Vehicle overturn | Controller overreaction | Robust control systems |
| **GM Cruise Motorcycle** | Late 2017 | GM Cruise | Motorcyclist injury | Lane change abort dilemma | Conservative planning algorithms |
| **Uber Fatality** | March 2018 | Uber | Pedestrian death | Multiple system failures | Industry-wide safety overhaul |

### Critical Case Study 1: Waymo vs. Bus (March 2016)

**What Happened**: A self-driving Google car (now Waymo) ran into the side of a bus when it attempted to pull out from behind an obstacle. The Google car software believed the bus would not attempt to pass it, as the gap between itself and the cars in the next lane was too narrow.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Prediction Failure**: AI couldn't predict human bus driver behavior
- **Gap Assessment Error**: Buses habitually use smaller gaps than expected
- **Reaction Time**: By detection time, collision was unavoidable

**Lessons Learned**:
- Human behavior prediction is extremely challenging
- Conservative assumptions about other drivers can be wrong
- Need robust models for different vehicle types and driver behaviors

**Industry Response**:
- **Waymo 2025**: Now uses behavioral modeling with 20 billion miles of simulation data
- **Tesla**: Neural networks trained on aggressive driver scenarios
- **Mercedes**: Conservative Level 3 systems avoid complex prediction scenarios

### Critical Case Study 2: Uber Fatality (March 2018, Tempe, Arizona)

**The Tragedy**: The incident occurred where a pedestrian was walking her bicycle across the road in an unmarked area. The victim, Elaine Herzberg, was a 49-year-old woman from Tempe.

**Multiple System Failures**:

#### **Failure 1: Human Monitoring**
- **Problem**: The safety driver was inattentive and allegedly watching Hulu at the time. Uber didn't have any way in the vehicle to assess the driver's attentiveness.
- **Industry Fix**: Driver monitoring systems now mandatory
  - **Tesla**: Cabin camera monitors driver attention
  - **Mercedes**: Eye-tracking for Level 3 certification
  - **Waymo**: Eliminated safety drivers entirely in operational areas

#### **Failure 2: Perception System**
- **Problem**: Upon initial detection at six seconds to impact, the victim was first classified as an unknown object, then misclassified as a vehicle, and then misclassified as a bicycle. The decision made by the autonomy software was to ignore the detections.
- **Industry Response**:
  - **Tesla**: Vision-only system with consistent object classification
  - **Waymo**: Multi-sensor fusion prevents single-sensor failures
  - **Mercedes**: LiDAR + camera redundancy for Level 3 certification

#### **Failure 3: Emergency Systems Disabled**
- **Problem**: 1.3 seconds before the crash, the Volvo emergency braking system did detect the pedestrian but Uber had disabled the Volvo system when in autonomous mode.
- **Critical Learning**: Never disable safety-critical backup systems
- **Current Practice**: All modern AV systems maintain emergency braking as final backup

### üìä **Uber Fatality: System Failure Analysis**

| System | Failure Mode | Timeline | Current Industry Fix |
|--------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Human Monitoring** | Driver watching Hulu | Throughout incident | Mandatory driver monitoring cameras |
| **Perception** | Object misclassification | 6-1.3 seconds before | Multi-sensor fusion, improved AI |
| **Planning** | Ignored uncertain detection | 1.3 seconds before | Conservative uncertainty handling |
| **Emergency Backup** | Volvo system disabled | 1.3 seconds before | Never disable safety systems |
| **Human Fallback** | Inattentive safety driver | Final 1.3 seconds | Better training, elimination |

### Critical Case Study 3: GM Cruise Motorcycle Incident (2017)

**What Happened**: A GM Cruise Chevy Bolt knocked over a motorcyclist after it aborted a lane change maneuver. The motorcyclist who was lane splitting moved forward beside the Bolt and blocked the return maneuver.

**Dilemma Situation**: Vehicle faced impossible choice between hitting motorcycle or multiple cars

**Industry Evolution**:
- **Cruise 2025**: Now uses prediction models for motorcycle behavior
- **Tesla**: Neural networks trained on lane-splitting scenarios
- **Mercedes**: Avoids complex scenarios entirely with conservative ODD

### Critical Case Study 4: Uber Rollover (2017)

**What Happened**: An Uber self-driving vehicle overreacted during a minor collision caused by another vehicle and ended up overturning. The controller had likely not been tested for such a scenario and overreacted.

**Root Cause**: Dynamic models of the vehicle don't assume significant disturbance forces from other vehicles acting on the car.

**Lesson**: Robust control systems must handle unexpected disturbances

### üìä **Lessons Learned: Before vs After**

| Problem Area | Pre-2018 Industry Practice | Post-2018 Industry Standard |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Driver Monitoring** | Optional, basic attention detection | Mandatory eye/head tracking systems |
| **Perception Uncertainty** | Ignore uncertain detections | Conservative response to uncertainty |
| **System Redundancy** | Single-point failure modes | Multiple independent backup systems |
| **Emergency Braking** | Sometimes disabled during testing | Always active as final safety net |
| **Testing Scope** | Limited scenario coverage | Extensive edge case validation |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Self-regulation by companies | Government certification requirements |

**‚úÖ Safety**: The process of avoiding unreasonable risk of harm to a living thing
- Note: "Unreasonable" - some risk always exists
- Goal: Reduce risk to acceptable levels

**üö© Hazard**: A potential source of unreasonable risk of harm or a threat to safety
- Example: Software bug that could cause accident

### üìä **Safety Terminology Reference**

| Term | Definition | Example | Risk Assessment |
|------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Harm** | Physical harm to a living thing | Injury, death, property damage | Severity measure |
| **Risk** | Probability √ó Severity of harm | 0.001% chance of fatal accident | Very high due to severity |
| **Safety** | Avoiding unreasonable risk | Acceptable risk threshold | Risk < acceptable level |
