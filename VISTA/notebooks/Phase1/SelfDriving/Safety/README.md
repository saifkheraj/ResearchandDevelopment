## 🛠️ Safety Assessment Frameworks

### Generic Analytical Frameworks

#### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) - Top-Down Approach

**Concept**: Start with system failure, identify all possible causes

```
Car Crash (Root Event)
├── Software Failure
│   ├── Perception Code Malfunction
│   └── Cybersecurity Problem (Hacked)
└── Hardware Failure
    ├── Manufacturing Defects
    └── Material Imperfections
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Root Event** | System failure to avoid | Car crash |
| **Logic Gates** | Intermediate failure causes | Software OR Hardware failure |
| **Leaf Nodes** | Specific failure rates with probabilities | Perception failure: 0.001/hour |

**Probability Calculation**: Use Boolean logic (AND = product, OR = sum for independent events) --> in leaf nodes.

#### FMEA (Failure Modes & Effects Analysis) - Bottom-Up Approach

**Concept**: Start with component failures, analyze all possible effects

**FMEA Process Steps**:

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1. Identify** | List all system processes and failure modes | Component failure list |
| **2. Assess Severity** | Rate consequences (1-10, 10=most severe) | Severity score |
| **3. Assess Occurrence** | Rate frequency (1-10, 10=most frequent) | Occurrence score |
| **4. Assess Detection** | Rate detection likelihood (1-10, 10=impossible to detect) | Detection score |
| **5. Calculate RPN** | Risk Priority Number = Severity × Occurrence × Detection | Priority ranking |

**FMEA Example: Gravel Patch Scenario**

| Failure Mode | Effect | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN | Priority |
|--------------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Gravel patch** | Physical crash | 10 | 4 | 10 | 400 | 1st |
| **GPS sync failure** | Navigation error | 6 | 5 | 10 | 300 | 2nd |
| **Motion prediction** | Poor planning | 5 | 3 | 10 | 150 | 3rd |
| **Sign perception** | Missed traffic sign | 8 | 2 | 6 | 96 | 4th |

#### HAZOP (Hazard & Operability Study) - Qualitative Brainstorming

**Purpose**: Early-stage qualitative risk identification using guide words . It is a qualitative brainstorming process.

| Guide Word | Application | Example Failure Mode |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Not** | Function doesn't occur | Brakes not applied |
| **More** | Excessive function | Over-steering |
| **Less** | Insufficient function | Under-braking |
| **Early** | Function occurs too soon | Premature lane change |
| **Late** | Function occurs too late | Delayed emergency stop |

### Automotive-Specific Safety Frameworks

#### Functional Safety (FUSA) - ISO 26262

**Definition**: Absence of unreasonable risk from hardware/software malfunctions

**ASIL Levels** (Automotive Safety Integrity Levels):

| ASIL Level | Risk Level | Requirements | Example Systems |
|------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **ASIL D** | Highest | Most stringent development | Airbag control, brake systems |
| **ASIL C** | High | Rigorous testing | Engine management |
| **ASIL B** | Medium | Standard automotive | Anti-lock braking |
| **ASIL A** | Low | Basic requirements | Interior lighting |

**Functional Safety V-Model Process**:

```
Requirements → Hazard Analysis → Implementation
     ↓              ↓               ↓
Specification → Risk Assessment → Low-level Code
     ↓              ↓               ↓
System Design → Safety Goals → Unit Testing
     ↑              ↑               ↑
Validation ← Integration Testing ← Verification
     ↑              ↑               ↑
Assessment ← System Testing ← Component Testing
```
