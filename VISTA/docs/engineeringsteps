# üìò Documentation: Software vs. Mechanical/Physical Product Development

This document explains the parallels between **software development** and **mechanical/physical product development**, showing how concepts like Figma, architecture, config, code, and deployment map across domains.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software Product Development Flow

1. **Figma / UI Mockups**

   * Purpose: Visualize app flow, user interface, interactions.
   * Output: Design prototypes.

2. **Architecture Design**

   * Purpose: Define system modules, APIs, and data flow.
   * Output: High-level diagrams of services and their relationships.

3. **Config Files & Code Structure**

   * Purpose: Define rules, settings, and folder structures.
   * Output: Config (JSON/YAML) + boilerplate project code.

4. **Coding & Development**

   * Purpose: Build features, connect modules, write business logic.
   * Output: Working application.

5. **Testing (QA, Debugging)**

   * Purpose: Verify correctness, performance, security.
   * Output: Bug fixes, stable release.

6. **Deployment**

   * Purpose: Launch app to servers/app stores.
   * Output: End-user product.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical/Physical Product Development Flow

1. **CAD Modeling (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, AutoCAD)**

   * Purpose: Visualize the product, create 3D digital models.
   * Output: 3D CAD file (digital twin).

2. **System / Assembly Design**

   * Purpose: Define how parts interact (joints, motors, sensors).
   * Output: Assembly diagrams.

3. **Engineering Drawings (ASME Y14.5 GD\&T)**

   * Purpose: Define dimensions, tolerances, materials.
   * Output: 2D blueprints for machinists.

4. **Manufacturing (CNC, 3D Printing, Injection Molding)**

   * Purpose: Build parts in the physical world.
   * Output: Physical components.

5. **Prototyping & Testing**

   * Purpose: Verify strength, motion, usability.
   * Output: Functional prototype.

6. **Production / Deployment**

   * Purpose: Mass manufacture, package, distribute.
   * Output: Market-ready product.

## üìä Comparison Table

| Stage                | Software World               | Mechanical World                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Design visualization | Figma / Sketch               | CAD (SolidWorks, Fusion 360)           |
| Architecture         | System architecture diagrams | Assembly/system design                 |
| Rules/constraints    | Config files (JSON/YAML)     | Engineering drawings + GD\&T           |
| Build                | Code & compile               | Manufacturing (CNC, 3D printing, etc.) |
| Debugging/testing    | QA, unit tests, debugging    | Prototyping, stress/motion testing     |
| Deployment           | Server/app store launch      | Mass production & distribution         |

## ‚úÖ Key Insight

* **CAD is the Figma of engineering/robotics.**
* **Engineering drawings are like config files.**
* **Manufacturing is deployment.**
* **Prototyping = debugging.**

This parallel lets computer scientists apply familiar thinking to physical/mechanical product design.
