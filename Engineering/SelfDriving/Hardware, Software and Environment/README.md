# Sensors/Hardware

## 📚 Course Introduction

Every major AV company - from Tesla to Waymo to Mercedes - makes critical decisions about sensor selection and computing architecture that determine their vehicle's capabilities and limitations.

**Key Learning Quote**: *"Even the best perception algorithms are limited by the quality of their sensor data. Careful selection of sensors can go a long way to simplifying the self-driving perception task."*

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. **Sensor fundamentals** and the two main categories
2. **Each sensor type's** strengths, limitations, and use cases
3. **Industry implementations** by major AV companies
4. **Computing hardware** requirements and solutions
5. **How to select** appropriate sensor configurations

## 📖 What is a Sensor?

**Definition**: A sensor is any device that measures or detects some property of the environment, or changes to that property over time.

### Two Fundamental Categories:

#### 🌍 **Exteroceptive Sensors** (External Environment)
- **"Extero" = Outside/Surroundings**
- Measure properties of the world around the vehicle
- Examples: Cameras, LiDAR, RADAR, Sonar

#### 🚗 **Proprioceptive Sensors** (Internal Vehicle State)
- **"Proprios" = Internal/One's Own**
- Measure properties of the ego vehicle itself
- Examples: GPS, IMU, Wheel Odometry

# Environment Representation - Autonomous Vehicle Mapping Systems - Complete Technical Guide

## 📚 Course Overview

 Every major AV company - Tesla, Waymo, Mercedes, BMW - relies on these three map types, though they implement them differently based on their technology approach.

## 🗺️ The Three Essential Maps

Every autonomous vehicle uses these three complementary mapping systems:

1. **🎯 Localization Map** - "Where exactly am I?"
2. **🚧 Occupancy Grid Map** - "What obstacles are around me?"
3. **🛣️ Detailed Road Map** - "What are the driving rules here?"

Think of it like this: If you were driving in a foreign city, you'd need:
- A GPS to know your exact position (Localization Map)
- Eyes to see obstacles and other cars (Occupancy Grid)
- Knowledge of traffic rules and lane markings (Detailed Road Map)

## 📦 Map 1: Localization Map

### 🎯 Purpose: Precise Vehicle Positioning

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1595750-aa4e-424a-843a-c05bf4eb13d8)

**What it does:** Determines your exact position within centimeters, not just "somewhere on Main Street"

### How It Works

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- **LiDAR points** continuously scan environment as vehicle moves
- **Camera features** capture distinctive visual landmarks
- Creates a **point cloud representation** of surroundings

**Step 2: Real-Time Comparison**
- New sensor data compared to stored localization map
- System finds matching features to determine exact position
- **Alignment process** calculates precise vehicle location

**Step 3: Position Estimation**
- Combined with GPS, IMU, and wheel sensors
- Produces centimeter-level accuracy positioning
- Used for vehicle control and navigation

### 🏢 Industry Implementation Examples

#### **Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot (Level 3)**
- **Technology**: HD LiDAR + camera feature matching
- **Coverage**: Complete German Autobahn network (8,196 miles)
- **Accuracy**: ±5cm positioning for certified autonomous operation
- **Real Use**: Enables hands-off driving at 95 km/h on highways
- **How they do it**: Pre-mapped all Autobahn landmarks, real-time matching for precision

#### **Waymo (Google)**
- **Technology**: Dense LiDAR point clouds + visual landmarks
- **Coverage**: Detailed maps of San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, Los Angeles
- **Accuracy**: ±2cm positioning in mapped areas

- **Coverage**: Crowdsourced mapping from entire Tesla fleet
- **Accuracy**: ±10-20cm positioning using visual landmarks
- **Real Use**: Supports Full Self-Driving (FSD) navigation
- **How they do it**: Every Tesla contributes visual features to global map database

### 📊 Technical Specifications

```

## 📦 Map 2: Occupancy Grid Map

### 🚧 Purpose: Obstacle Detection and Collision Avoidance

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edbdc118-a752-4225-91a8-9c3a042b1cbe)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e8f45a-d41a-454a-bb75-58f65b9ae015)

These black may represent poles, buildings etc. silver part keeps moving as car moves.

**What it does:** Creates a "safety bubble" around your vehicle showing exactly where obstacles are located

### How It Works

**Step 1: Data Input**
- **LiDAR point clouds** provide 3D obstacle data
- **Continuous scanning** as vehicle moves through environment
- **Real-time updates** every 100 milliseconds

**Step 2: Filtering Process**
1. **Remove dynamic objects**: Cars, pedestrians, cyclists (handled separately)
2. **Remove drivable surfaces**: Road, parking lots (not obstacles)
3. **Remove irrelevant objects**: Overhead branches, distant objects
4. **Keep static obstacles**: Buildings, parked cars, barriers, curbs

**Step 3: Probabilistic Representation**
- Environment divided into **grid cells** (typically 10-20cm squares)
- Each cell assigned **probability of occupancy** (0-100%)
- **Uncertainty handling**: Accounts for sensor noise and movement
- **Temporal updates**: Probability refined over multiple observations

### 🏢 Industry Implementation Examples

#### **Tesla Occupancy Networks**
- **Technology**: Camera-based occupancy prediction using neural networks
- **Grid Size**: 200m x 200m around vehicle, 20cm resolution
- **Update Rate**: 10 Hz real-time updates

- **Grid Size**: 150m x 150m, 10cm resolution for high precision
- **Update Rate**: 20 Hz with sensor fusion
- **Real Use**: Path planning for autonomous rides, obstacle avoidance
- **Advantage**: Highest accuracy occupancy detection in industry
- **How it works**: Multiple sensors cross-validate obstacle presence

#### **BMW/Mobileye Approach**

- **Update Rate**: 15 Hz processing
- **Real Use**: Level 3 highway driving, automated parking
- **Focus**: Cost-effective implementation for mass production
- **How it works**: EyeQ chips process camera/radar for real-time grids

### 🎯 Real-World Example Visualization

```
Occupancy Grid View (Top-down):
[B][B][B][B][B]  B = Building (100% occupied)
[·][·][P][·][·]  P = Parked car (95% occupied)  
[·][·][V][·][·]  V = Your vehicle
[·][·][·][·][C]  C = Construction barrier (90% occupied)
[R][R][R][R][R]  R = Road (0% occupied - drivable)
[·] = Free space (5% occupied)
```

### 💡 How You Can Implement This

**For Developers:**
```
1. Set Up Grid:
   - Define grid size around vehicle (e.g., 100m x 100m)
   - Choose resolution (10-50cm per cell)
   - Initialize all cells to 50% probability

2. Process Sensor Data:
   - Filter out dynamic objects from perception
   - Remove ground plane and drivable surfaces
